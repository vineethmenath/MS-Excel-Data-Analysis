Freshco Hypermarket Capstone Project: Operational & Customer Data Analysis (Jan-Sep 2021)

**Overview**

This project presents an in-depth data analysis of Freshco Hypermarket's operational and customer data spanning from January 1, 2021, to September 30, 2021. The analysis covers four main areas: Order Level, Completion Rate, Customer Level, and Delivery Level. The primary goal was to uncover performance trends, identify areas for improvement, and derive data-driven strategies to enhance operational efficiency and boost customer satisfaction and lifetime value.
The entire analysis, including data manipulation, calculations, and visualization, was conducted using Microsoft Excel.

**Key Features & Insights**
1. Order Level Analysis üõí
 * Peak Order Time & Area: The afternoon slot has the maximum number of orders, with HSR Layout recording the maximum number of orders due to a high number of pickup points.
 * Top Delivery Areas (Absolute Orders): HSR Layout (15,657), ITI Layout (3,946), and Harlur (1,309) are the top three areas.
 * Delivery Charges: Charges are typically high for late night orders. The peak delivery charge for late night orders was 17% in February.
 * Discounts: Maximum discounts are given in August as it is the festive season. Least discounts (1%) were observed from January to April. Highest discount is given for orders placed during the night slot.
2. Completion Rate Analysis ‚úÖ
 * Overall Completion: An average of 99.55% of orders were successfully delivered.
 * High Completion Slots: There is a 100% completion rate on Sunday evenings and Wednesday nights. Sundays, in general, have maximum successful deliveries compared to other days.
 * Low/Zero Completion Areas: Areas like Cux town and Whitefield have zero successful orders.
 * Successful Months: May and July have the maximum number of successful orders.
3. Customer Level Analysis üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë
 * Acquisition Source & Revenue: The highest number of customer acquisitions are through the Organic platform.
   * Revenue generated through Organic source is highest, and Instagram has the lowest revenue.
   * Aggregate LTV from Snapchat stands high, and the least is from Instagram.
 * Acquisition Trends: Customer acquisition was on a decreasing trend from January to September, with exceptions in April and May.
 * Low LTV/Completion: 17 customers have zero LTV. Customers acquired through Instagram and offline campaigns have a low completion rate.
4. Delivery Level Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è
 * Late Deliveries: Orders placed in May are usually delivered late. Afternoon orders are usually delivered late due to heavy traffic and customer demand.
 * Early Deliveries: Orders placed during late night are usually delivered early because of low traffic. Weekday orders are delivered earlier compared to weekend orders.
 * Delivery Charges Pattern: Brookfield has the highest delivery charges, with these being late night orders. ITI Layout has the lowest delivery charges.
 * Top 5 Delayed Delivery Areas: Mahadevapura, Brookefield, Vimanapura, Pattandur, and CV Raman Nagar.
 * 
**Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è**
 * Microsoft Excel: Used for all aspects of the project, including:
   * Data Cleaning and Manipulation.
   * Creating Pivot Tables and various formulas for calculations.
   * Data Analysis (Order Level, Completion Rate, Customer LTV, Delivery Time).
   * Data Visualization (Charts and conditional formatting for reports).
 * Microsoft Word (.docx): Used for compiling the final report (Freshco Hypermarket Capstone report.docx).

**Conclusion:**
The analysis highlighted significant operational and customer trends. Key strategies should focus on:
 * Late Night Strategy: Leverage the early delivery time of late-night orders due to low traffic to balance against their high delivery charges.
 * Afternoon Slot Optimization: Since the afternoon slot has the maximum orders, efforts should focus on mitigating the late delivery times in this slot, possibly by optimizing routes or increasing delivery personnel.
 * HSR Layout: Given the maximum orders are from this area, ensure service remains a top priority to maintain customer base.
 * Targeted Campaigns: Address the low completion rate and low LTV from Instagram and Offline campaigns by refining targeting or improving the first-time customer experience.
 * Addressing Zero LTV Customers: Investigate the root cause for the 17 customers with zero LTV to prevent churn and improve first-order experience.
